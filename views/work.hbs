                <h2>Writings and public debate</h2>
                <p>Harris's writing focuses on philosophy, neuroscience, and criticism of religion, for which he is best known, and he has written for a variety of outlets.</p>
                <p>Harris engaged in a lengthy debate with conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan on the Internet forum Beliefnet. In April 2007, Harris debated with the evangelical pastor Rick Warren for Newsweek magazine. In April 2011, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on whether there can be an objective morality without God. In June and July 2018, he met with Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson for a series of debates on religion, particularly the relationship between religious values and scientific fact in defining truth.</p>
